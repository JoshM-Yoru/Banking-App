### To start the CRA Project

-Install dependencies with `npm i` and `npm install --save @types/styled-components` for type-safe styled components.
-Start the application with `npm start`

### Developer Workflow

1. Create a `branch` using the format `git checkout -b firstName-lastName`
2. To push the first timeto your branch using `git push -u origin <branch-name>`
3. Switch back up to main to pull up to date code using `git checkout main` and then `git pull`
4. Switch back to your branch using `git checkout <branch-name>`
5. Merge updates using `git merge main`
6. Work only on that branch.
7. Push changes to your remote branch using `git push`
8. Submit a pull request on github website to merge code.

#### Notes

Currently all merges to main require a pull request and that pull request has to be reviewed/approved by two other people on the devs team before it can be merged. If you make a pull request while you have a previous pull request pending, the most recent PR (when approved and merged) will absorb the previous PR. If conversations are opened on a particular PR they must be resolved before that PR can be merged into main.
